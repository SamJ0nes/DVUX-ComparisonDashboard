## Overview

This public repository contains a backup of my submitted DVUX (Design for User Experience) coursework, completed as part of my Computing degree. The project received a **High First-Class Grade**.

## Project Summary

The project is a data-driven dashboard web app developed using the following technologies:

* **XAMPP** web server
* **PHPMyAdmin (MariaDB/MySQL)** for database management
* **PHP** for server-side data retrieval
* **JavaScript** for client-side interaction and data manipulation
* **HTML/CSS** for the front-end structure and styling
* **Chart.js** for interactive data visualisation

## UX Process

A comprehensive design process was followed:

* Created a detailed project report to break down the **aims and objectives** into actionable **requirements**
* Developed **user personas** and **scenarios** to inform the user experience
* Generated **user stories** that aligned with both the requirements and the target audience
* Designed **wireframes**, **mock-ups**, and **prototypes** to visualise the intended functionality and layout
* Documented **Information Architecture** to list all digital assets of the site

## Dashboard Features

The final dashboard includes two key charts:

1. **Price vs. Protein Ratio**
   Visualises the relationship between snack price and protein content, helping users identify snacks that offer better value for protein.

2. **Nutritional Information vs. Daily Reference Intake (DRI)**
   Compares snacksâ€™ nutritional values (per serving) as a percentage of the Daily Reference Intake (DRI).

### Additional Features

* **Filters and facets** for refined data selection
* **Alternative chart views** for comparison
* **Graph annotations and visual indicators** to assist users in choosing healthier, cost-effective workout snacks
